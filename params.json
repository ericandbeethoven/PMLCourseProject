{"name":"Ericandbeethoven.GitHub.io","tagline":"Course Project for Coursera Practical Machine Learning","body":"### The Course Project Problem.\r\nThe goal of your project is to predict the manner in which the six healthy human subjects wearing accelerometers\r\nperforming the unilateral dumbbell biceps curl weight lifting exercise. \r\n\r\nAccelerometers measure bodily movements.\r\n\r\nThe participants were instructed to perform the exercise in one of five different fashions:\r\n* exactly according to the specification (Class A), \r\n* throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), \r\n* lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), \r\n* lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) \r\n* and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).\r\n\r\nThis dependent variable is the \"classe\" variable in the training set. \r\n\r\nThe project deliverables are this report describing how the model was built, how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error is, and why the choices for all the above were made. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
